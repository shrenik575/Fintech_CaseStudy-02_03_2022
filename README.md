First Assignment - Fintech Case Study - Domain : Robo Advisor - WealthSimple
Fintech Case Study:
Domain: Robo Advisors
Company: WealthSimple

##Overview and Origin:

WealthSimple is a Canadian Fintech company founded by Michael Katchen in September 2014 (Unaru, 2022). It provides specialised digital platforms for Self-Directed investing, Autopilot or Robo Advisory investments, and it just launched another platform for investments in crypto currencies.
Michael Katchen founded yet another company before Wealthsimple named 1000Memories which was bought by Ancestry.com (Unaru, 2022). And during this time his co-workers came to him for advise regarding investing. To assist his co-workers Michael prepared a complex spreadsheet which became very popular. This is where the idea of WealthSimple was born. Michael’s objective was simple – Investing should be for everyone, and it should not be complex. With this in mind Michael acquired Canadian ShareOwners Investments Inc – company providing self-directed trading platform to Canadians with about 10000 clients and $400 million dollars in assets under management. (Unaru, 2022)
The Goal of Wealthsimple in their own words is “We invest your money in a globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, and our cutting-edge technology helps you earn the best possible return, while optimizing your tax bill. This means we do things like automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting — services that were only available to the ultra rich until now or that most people found too time-consuming and tedious to do on their own.” (WealthSimple, n.d.)
Today WealthSimple has $15 billion dollars in assets under management, about 1.5 million clients using their platform. (WealthSimple, n.d.) WealthSimple just raised $750 million dollars in private equity investments and their investors include Power Corporation of Canada, as well as Canadian music artist and celebrity Drake. With the recent fundraising the company is now valued at about $5 billion dollars. (Unaru, 2022)



##Business Activities:

In wealth management industry advice comes with steep fees. More sophisticated advice you need, it comes with even higher fees which then takes away from the returns you aim to achieve from your investments. It has come to a point where ordinary investors who wish to start investing with relatively small amount of savings are priced out of the sound advice solely because of the fees charged by Investment advisors are not worth the amount of money ordinary investors usually start with. This is the gap that WealthSimple identified. 

WealthSimple offers a platform to all investors with any amount of money they wish to invest by leveraging technology especially in the traditionally high fee-oriented investment advice industry. WealthSimple offers ultra-low fee high-end investment advice such as automatic rebalancing, dividend re-investing, and tax -loss harvesting – some of the services available only to Investors with substantial amount of money to invest in - by leveraging technology.
Although WealthSimple offers its services to all kinds of investors, its key target market is the young investors who are just starting out but will also take financial control of their household in the future. Millennials are expected to receive about $68 Trillion dollars in assets from Baby boomers in heritance over the next decade or so (Partida, 2021). And millennials are more inclined towards learning about investing on their own and taking control of their own investments (Bank, 2022).

WealthSimple offers a host of platforms:
-	Robo-Advisor platform for automated investing with an option to get insights about the portfolio performance from a live financial advisor at ultra-low fees.
-	Self-Directed DIY investing platform which comes with an option to automate spare-change investing.
-	Crypto platform to offer trading in crypto currencies.
-	A tax filing platform to file taxes and get advice on the same, again at ultra-low fees.

Now, some might wonder how WealthSimple is able to provide holistic investment experience at heavily discounted rate than their competitors in the industry. And the answer simple – One Word – Fintech. WealthSimple is using leveraging technology way more than traditional financial firms have been using. WealthSimple has pivoted in Financial Technology and has built and ecosystem that allows them to operate at low costs by identifying and reducing operational inefficiencies leveraging technology. Due to this they are able to transfer the benefit of low cost to their clients and provide same or better level of service to their clients than a traditional investment advisory firm offers. 

It is key to understand that the inception of WealthSimple and its ecosystem is designed around low fee structure. However, all the traditional banks/investment firms have a completely opposite philosophy which is built around charging high fees to generate revenue. And this is the very reason that gives WealthSimple an advantage because it will take quite some time for the traditional investment firms to change their processes and revenue generation models such that they can compete with technology driven firms such as WealthSimple.

WealthSimple uses applications such as JavaScript, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, Google Drive, Bootstrap, ES6, AngularJS, Redis, Amazon S3 and EC2, SASS, Ruby, ReactNative, GraphQL, Redux, AWS Lamda, Rails and more (WealthSimple, n.d.) to prepare trading algorithms to provide automated investing (Robo-Advisor) by using Index Investing technique and using their Index Exchange Traded Funds by matching client’s age, risk appetite, and time horizon with their goals, and offering a portfolio mix which rebalances on its own.

##Landscape:

The technology behind Robo-Advising isn’t new and has been since around 2000s. The technology was used by sophisticated hedge funds and investment firms as an operational tool for the advisors to easily manage hundreds of client portfolios as well as executing cost effective trades. However, a company named Betterment – the first company to provide sophisticated Robo-Advising was launched in 2008 after the financial crash. Betterment saw the potential of operational tools being available to clients using appropriate GUIs so that they can offer basic investing services at cost effective fees than their competitors (Frankenfield, 2022). 
Within last decade, Robo-Advisor services have become more sophisticated than ever, and innovations in this industry has enabled companies to offer services that can mimic tactical investing strategies similar to those adopted by multi-billion dollar hedge funds (Frankenfield, 2022).
Some of the other major companies offering Robo-Advisory services are Betterment, BMO Smartfolios, RBC InvestEase, and the largest company by far is Vanguard Personal Advisor services with about $231 billion dollars of assets under management as of 2021 (Frankenfield, 2022).

##Results

Since its launch in 2014 WealthSimple has disrupted the Canadian investment industry landscape. All of the six big banks in Canada have been losing millennial customer base to WealthSimple due to its low fee better service, and tech intensive platform appeal, as well as the ease of automated investing with low cost advise that comes with it. 
Robo-Advisory industry uses assets under management as a core metric for success as it in turn decides the valuation of the company. WealthSimple has provided record shattering numbers with about 1.5 million active users and about $1.5 billion in assets undermanagement, WealthSimple has secured a $5 billion valuation – one of the highest in Canadian history in Fintech Space. To put this in perspective, one of the big 6 banks in Canada – BMO - sold one its asset management business with $124 billion in assets under management for $870 million compared to WealthSimple raising $750 million at a stage where its at $1.5 billion in assets under management (Pelletier, 2021). This shows WealthSimple is ahead of its competitors and is emerging as a leader in the Robo-Advising fintech domain.

##Recommendation:

A Company like WealthSimple is poised to grow as the Robo-Advisor industry is estimated to grow at a CAGR of about 50.19% year over year with an overall valuation of $34.05 billion dollars by 2023 (MarketWatch, n.d.). 
One of the opportunities of growth that we can recommend to WealthSimple is by offering a customizable solution to automated investing. Currently WealthSimple offers pre-designed index portfolios for automated investing that best fit client portfolios. However, each investor is different and more sophisticated investors that don’t need advice but still want to leverage automated investing for their own benefit can use a customization tool that allows investors to create their own algorithm via user friendly GUIs that speak via APIs to the back-end application to create custom algorithms for the clients. To implement such tool, along with existing applications that WealthSimple uses, it can adopt using Alpaca APIs.

This can be another tranche of product that WealthSimple offers and can generate revenue via a fee-based model to allow such customizations for sophisticated investors.
